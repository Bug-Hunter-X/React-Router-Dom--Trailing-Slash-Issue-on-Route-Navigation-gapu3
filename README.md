# React Router Dom Trailing Slash Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router Dom v6 related to handling routes with trailing slashes.  The application correctly navigates to '/about', but fails to navigate to '/about/', causing unexpected behavior.  The solution involves configuring the routes to handle trailing slashes appropriately.

## Bug Description:

The provided code uses `react-router-dom` v6.  Navigating to '/about' works as expected, displaying the 'About' component. However, navigating to '/about/' (with a trailing slash) results in a 404 or the application may not render the expected component correctly.

## Solution:

The issue stems from how React Router handles paths with and without trailing slashes.  The solution provided modifies the route configuration to explicitly handle these variations, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of trailing slashes.
